- `openclaw`: Personal AI assistant runtime (fork).
- `Project-Go-Forward`: Config-driven multi-agent business assistant framework (GCP + web UI).

## Archived / Superseded
- `SapphireAI`, `AsterAI`: superseded by `Sapphire` (kept for historical reference).
- `quant-ai-trader`, `binance-trade-bot`, `freqtrade`, `freqtrade-strategies`, `tensortrade`, `FreedomBot`, `fullsail_scanner`: consolidated into `Sapphire` or retired (see `Sapphire/docs/REPO_CONSOLIDATION.md`).
- `CRM`, `ari_gato_binance_bot`: archived placeholders.

## For Agentic Coders
Each repo has an `AGENTS.md` file with the fastest entry points (what to read first, key paths, and local dev commands).
