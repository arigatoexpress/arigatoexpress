## Active
- `Sapphire`: Autonomous trading control plane (ASTER/LIGHTER) with Telegram governance.
- `openclaw`: Personal AI assistant runtime (fork).
- `Project-Go-Forward`: Config-driven multi-agent business assistant framework (GCP + web UI).
- `Rari_AI_Telegram_Manager`: Telegram business development intelligence + lead management.

## Archived / Superseded
- `SapphireAI`, `AsterAI`: superseded by `Sapphire` (kept for historical reference).
- `CRM`, `ari_gato_binance_bot`: archived placeholders.

## For Agentic Coders
Each repo has an `AGENTS.md` file with the fastest entry points (what to read first, key paths, and local dev commands).
